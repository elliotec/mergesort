=========

Mergesort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array, compares it's results, and builds it back up in order.

Usage
====

Insantiate a new class of MergeSort: 

<pre><code>mailman = MergeSort.new</code></pre>

Then call sorter on that instance with a sortable array and print it:

<pre><code>puts mailman.sorter([3,6,4,5,7,1,2,9,8])</code></pre>

Sources
=====

I used wikipedia and Nick's whiteboard example as major sources, and Joel was a huge help in explaining the whole concept to me.
